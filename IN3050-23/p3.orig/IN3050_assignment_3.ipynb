    "\n",
    "Before you begin the exercise, review the rules at this website: https://www.uio.no/english/studies/examinations/compulsory-activities/mn-ifi-mandatory.html , in particular the paragraph on cooperation. This is an individual assignment. You are not allowed to deliver together or copy/share source-code/answers with others. Read also the \"Routines for handling suspicion of cheating and attempted cheating at the University of Oslo\" https://www.uio.no/english/about/regulations/studies/studies-examinations/routines-cheating.html By submitting this assignment, you confirm that you are familiar with the rules and the consequences of breaking them.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Deadline**: Friday, April 21, 2023, 23:59\n",
    "\n",
    "Your submission should be delivered in Devilry. You may redeliver in Devilry before the deadline, but include all files in the last delivery, as only the last delivery will be read. You are recommended to upload preliminary versions hours (or days) before the final deadline.\n",

    "### What to deliver?\n",
    "\n",
    "You are recommended to solve the exercise in a Jupyter notebook, but you might solve it in a Python program if you prefer.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you choose Jupyter, you should deliver the notebook. You should answer all questions and explain what you are doing in Markdown. Still, the code should be properly commented. The notebook should contain results of your runs. In addition, you should make a pdf of your solution which shows the results of the runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you prefer not to use notebooks, you should deliver the code, your run results, and a pdf-report where you answer all the questions and explain your work.\n",

    "Deliver one single zipped folder (.zip, .tgz or .tar.gz) which contains your complete solution.\n",

    "Important: if you weren’t able to finish the assignment, use the PDF report/Markdown to elaborate on what you’ve tried and what problems you encountered.

    "### Goals of the exercise\n",
    "This exercise has three parts. The first part is focused on Principal Component Analysis (PCA). You will go through some basic theory, and implent PCA from scratch to do compression and visualization of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second part focuses on clustering using K-means. You will use `scikit-learn` to run K-means clustering, and use PCA to visualize the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last part ties supervised and unsupervised learning together in an effort to evaluate the output of K-means using a logistic regression for multi-class classification approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "The master students will also have to do one extra part about tuning PCA to balance compression with information lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools\n",
    "You may freely use code from the weekly exercises and the published solutions. In the first part about PCA you may **NOT** use ML libraries like `scikit-learn`. In the K-means part and beyond we encurage the use of `scikit-learn` to iterate quickly on the problems.\n",

We then considered two typical uses of PCA: for **visualization** on the *iris* dataset, and for **compression-decompression** on the *lfw* dateset.\n",

    "We then moved to consider the k-means algorithm. In this case we used the implementation provided by *scikit-learn* and we applied it to another prototypical unsupervised learning problem: **clustering**; we used *k-means* to process the *iris* dataset and we evaluated the results visually.\n",

    "In the final part, we considered two additional questions that may arise when using the above algorithms. For PCA, we considered the problem of **selection of hyper-parameters**, that is, how we can select the hyper-parameter of ou algorithm in a reasonable fashion. For k-means, we considered the problem of the **quantitative evaluation** of our results, that is, how can we measure the performance or usefulness of our algorithms. "
